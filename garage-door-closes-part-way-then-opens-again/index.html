<p>If your garage door opens and suddenly stops it might be because of your logic board. To correct the problem most models need to display green or amber indicator lights in both the sending and receiving eyes and they will glow steadily if wiring connections and alignment are correct. Im sure there is more than one cause of this problem but for me the issue was that the door was getting snagged slightly and once the chain pulls with too much tension it has an automatic failsafe and it stops pulling and lets the door down. The light is not flashing so they are not detecting a block. You push the button to close the garage door. If the door reverses part way down and you are sure there is no obstruction or binding increase the closing force a small amount and try it again. 5 Garage Door Problems And How You Can Solve Them.</p>

<p>Some older garage door openers do not have nicely labeled adjustment screws for force and travel limits. My garage door will start to close and when it gets to a certain point opens back up. Use the control on the wall and hold the button to close the door do not let go until it closes all the way If this closes then its a sensor problem you. If it closes before that distance has been traveled it thinks something is wrong and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. Answer 1 of 6.
